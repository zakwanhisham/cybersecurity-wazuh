# Wazuh

## What is Wazuh

Wazuh is a free and open source security platform that unifies XDR and SIEM capabilities.
It protects workloads across on-premises, virtualized, containerized, and cloud-based environments.

Wazuh helps organizations and individuals to protect their data assets against security threats.
It is widely used by thousands of organizations worldwide, from small business to large enterprises.

We will discuss about these three components of wazuh `components`, `architecture`, and common `use cases`.

## Components

There are 4 components in wazuh:

1. Wazuh indexer:
   - Highly scalable, full-text search, and analytics engine
   - **Indexes and stores alerts generated by Wazuh Server**
2. Wazuh Server:

## Wazuh Indexer

- Central component indexes and stores alerts generated by the wazuh server and provides near real-time data search and analytic capabilities.
- Can be configure as a single node or multi node cluster, to provide scalability and high availability.
- Store data in JSON doc format.
- Each doc correlates a set of keys, field names or properties, which can be:
  - `string`
  - `numbers`
  - `booleans`
  - `dates`
  - `arrays of values`
  - `geolocation`
  - `and many more`
- **_What is an index_**:
  - Collection of documents that are related to each other.
- Document stored in wazuh indexer are distributed across different containers know as `shards`
- We can distribute the documents across multiple shards, and distribute those shards across multiple nodes to ensure redundancy.
  - Protect system against hardware failures and increases query capacity as nodes are added to a cluster.

### Four Indices

| Index            | Description                                                                                                                                                                                  |

### Communication with Wazuh server

- Wazuh agent communicate with wazuh server to ship collected data and security-related events.
- The agent send operational data, reporting its config and status.
- Once connected, agent can be `upgraded`, `monitored`, and `configured remotely` from the wazuh server
- Communication takes place through secure channel (TCP or UDP), providing data encryption and compression in real-time.
- Includes flow control mechanism to avoid **flooding**, **queueing events**, and **protecting network bandwidth**.
- `Agent needs to be enroll before connecting to the server for the first time`

---

## Architecture

- Wazuh architecture is based on agents (endpoints) which is running on monitored endpoints, that forward security data to a central server.
- Supported agentless device such as:
  - firewalls
  - switches
  - routers
  - access point
- Can actively submit log data via:
  - Syslog
  - SSH
  - API
- Central server can decodes and analyzes the incoming information and passes the results along to the `wazuh indexer` for indexing and storage.

### What is wazuh indexer

- Collection of one or more nodes that communicate with each other to perform read and write operation on indices.
- Small deployment(do not require processing large amounts of data) can easily handled by a single-node cluster.
- Multi-node cluster are recommended when there are many monitored endpoints (large volume of data is anticipated / high availability is required)

### Production environment

- Recommended to deploy the Wazuh server and Wazuh indexer to different hosts.
- Filebeat is used to securely forward Wazuh alerts and archived events to the indexer cluster (single or multi-node) using `TLS` encryption.
- Image below shows that the solution components and how server and the indexer nodes can be configured as clusters, providing load balancing and high availability.

![deployment architecture](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/test-agent-nwfy.appspot.com/o/deployment-architecture1.png?alt=media&token=12392839-f954-4f7e-8dd5-4ebdbadd0bc7)

### Agent and server communication

- Agent will continuously sends events to the server for analysis and threat detection.
- Agent establishes a connection with the server service for agent connection (listen to port `1514` by default) to ship the data.
- Server then decodes and rule-checks the received events, utilizing the analysis engine.
- Event that trips the rules are then augmented with alert data such as **rule ID** and **rule name**.
- Event can be spooled to one or both of these files:
  - `/var/ossec/logs/archives/archives.json` contains all events whether they are tripped or not
  - `/var/ossec/logs/alerts/alerts.json` contains only the events that tripped the rule with high enough priority
- The message protocol uses AES encryption by default, with 128 bits per block and 256-bit keys (Blowfish encryption is optional).

### Server and indexer communication

- Server use `Filebeat`to send alert and event data to the Wazuh indexer, using TLS encryption.
- `Filebeat` reads the server output data and sends it to the indexer ( listen to port `9200/TCP` by default)
- Once data has been index, dashboard is used to mine and visualize the information

- Dashboard then queries the Wazuh RESTful API (listen to port `55000/TCP` by default) to display the configuration and status-related information of the server and agents.
- Can modify agents or server config settings through API calls.
- The communication is encrypted with TLS and authenticated with username and password.

| Dashboard | 443       | TCP           | Web user interface                            |

### Archival data storage

- Alerts and non-alert events are stored in files on the server, in addition to being send to the Indexer.
- Can be written in JSON format(`.json`), or plain text format(`.log`)
- Files are daily compressed and signed using **MD5**, **SHA1** and **SHA256** checksums.

## Installation guide

- Indexer and server can be installed on a single host or can be distributed in cluster configurations.
- There are two options to install

  - Assistant (**We will use this one during our demo**)
  - Manual

- Here are the workflow that you need to follow:

  ```
  1. Indexer
  2. Server
  3. Dashboard
  4. Agent
  ```

### Indexer

- **_Check the requirement before proceed_**
- [Requirements](https://documentation.wazuh.com/current/installation-guide/wazuh-indexer/index.html#requirements)

#### Assistant

1. Initial configuration

- Download the wazuh installation assistant and the configuration file.

  ```bash
  curl -sO https://packages.wazuh.com/4.7/wazuh-install.sh
  curl -sO https://packages.wazuh.com/4.7/config.yml
  ```

- Edit `./config.yml` file and replace the node names and IP values with the corresponding names and IP address.

```yaml
nodes:
  # Wazuh indexer nodes
  indexer:
    - name: node-1
      ip: "<indexer-node-ip>"
    #- name: node-2
    #  ip: "<indexer-node-ip>"
    #- name: node-3
    #  ip: "<indexer-node-ip>"

  # Wazuh server nodes
  # If there is more than one Wazuh server
  # node, each one must have a node_type
  server:
    - name: wazuh-1
      ip: "<wazuh-manager-ip>"
    #  node_type: master
    #- name: wazuh-2
    #  ip: "<wazuh-manager-ip>"
    #  node_type: worker
    #- name: wazuh-3
    #  ip: "<wazuh-manager-ip>"
    #  node_type: worker

  # Wazuh dashboard nodes
  dashboard:
    - name: dashboard
      ip: "<dashboard-node-ip>"
```

- Run the assistant with option `--generate-config-files` to generate the wazuh cluster key, certs, and pass. You can find these in `./wazuh-install-files.tar`

```bash
bash wazuh-install.sh --generate-config-files
```

2. Wazuh indexer nodes installation

- Download the wazuh installation assistant

```bash
curl -sO https://packages.wazuh.com/4.7/wazuh-install.sh
```

- Run the assistant with the option `--wazuh-indexer` and the node name to install and configure the wazuh indexer.
  - Node must be the same one used in `config.yml` for the initial configuration.
  - **_NOTE_**: Make sure that a copy of `wazuh-install-files.tar`,created during the initial config is place in your working dir.
  - Repeat this stage of installation process for every wazuh indexer node in your cluster

```bash
bash wazuh-install.sh --wazuh-indexer node-1
```

3. Cluster initialization

- Run the assistant with option `--start-cluster` on any wazuh indexer node to load the new cert info and start the cluster

```bash
bash wazuh-install.sh --start-cluster
```

- **_NOTE_**: Run once only, no need to run the command on every node.

4. Test the cluster installation

- Run the following command to get _admin_ pass.

```bash
tar -axf wazuh-install-files.tar wazuh-install-files/wazuh-passwords.txt -O | grep -P "\'admin\'" -A 1
```

- Run the following command to confirm that the installation is successful.
  - Replace `<ADMIN_PASSWORD>` and `<WAZUH_INDEXER_IP>`

```bash
curl -k -u admin:<ADMIN_PASSWORD> https://<WAZUH_INDEXER_IP>:9200
```

output:

```json
{
  "name": "node-1",
  "cluster_name": "wazuh-cluster",
  "cluster_uuid": "095jEW-oRJSFKLz5wmo5PA",
  "version": {
    "number": "7.10.2",
    "build_type": "rpm",
    "build_hash": "db90a415ff2fd428b4f7b3f800a51dc229287cb4",
    "build_date": "2023-06-03T06:24:25.112415503Z",
    "build_snapshot": false,
    "lucene_version": "9.6.0",
    "minimum_wire_compatibility_version": "7.10.0",
    "minimum_index_compatibility_version": "7.0.0"
  },
  "tagline": "The OpenSearch Project: https://opensearch.org/"
}
```

- To check if the cluster is working correctly, run this command

```bash
curl -k -u admin:<ADMIN_PASSWORD> https://<WAZUH_INDEXER_IP>:9200/_cat/nodes?v
```

#### Manual

### Server

#### Assistant

**Wazuh server cluster installation**

1. Download the wazuh installation assistant

```bash
curl -sO https://packages.wazuh.com/4.7/wazuh-install.sh
```

2. Run the assistant with the option `--wazuh-server` followed by the node name to install the wazuh server.

- The node name must be the same one used in `config.yml` for the initial config.
- **_NOTE_**: Make sure to copy the `wazuh-install-files.tar`, created during the initial config step, is placed in your working dir.

```bash
bash wazuh-install.sh --wazuh-server wazuh-1
```

3. The server is successfully installed.
